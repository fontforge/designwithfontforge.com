#### Directory Layout

- `_layouts/*.html` html template files

- `_includes/*.html` snippets of HTML that are included in pages and templates

- `assets/` CSS, JS and image files

- `_config.yml` Configuration for Jeykll (ignore this file)

- `en-US/` The site's contents, in US English. 

#### File Formats

Each page is in MarkDown format, with a `.md` file extension. These files are converted into corresponding .html files by Jekyll when they start with these lines:

```
    ---
    published: true
    layout: bookpage
    title: Page Title
    ---
```

#### How to build the site

First install Jekyll, with `gem`:

    sudo gem install jekyll

To see the site as it will appear after processing by Jekyll and review your edits live in a browser layout, run:

    jekyll --server

Now browse [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
