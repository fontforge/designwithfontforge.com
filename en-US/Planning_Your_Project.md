Now that you have a sense of how a font design can vary, you may want decide whether your project
will have only one font, if it will be a collection of several inter-related fonts, if it will be a
(now traditional) three or four-styles type family, or if it will be something even larger.

Common styles of type families include:

* A Regular and a Bold weight
* Regular, Bold, Italic &ndash; eventually with a Bold Italic
* Thin, Light, Book, Regular, Semi-Bold, Bold, Extra-Bold, Heavy and Black 
* Regular, Condensed, Bold and Bold Condensed
* Narrow, Condensed, Wide and Extra Wide
* Regular, Semi-Flourished, Flourished, Very Flourished, Extremely Flourished.

While there are reasons that typical pattens in families exist, you may find you want a very
different kind of grouping.

The scope of the project can be determined exclusively by your ambition and your amount of free
time. But project scopes are often determined by the use you have for the collection or family of
fonts, or, even further, by the needs of your client. Certainly for professional type designers,
the latter two questions are usually the determining factors.

## Glyph coverage

A font is still a font even if it has only one glyph in it. But a font can also have a few hundred
or even thousands of glyphs. If your project is self-initiated, then this choice is ultimately
arbitrary. You may decide you only want capitals, or that you want to include the glyphs found in
the other fonts you use. If you are doing work for a client, you may want to clarify which language
or languages the font is is meant to support. Your goal could also be to extend an existing font,
adding a few glyphs to make it work in one or more additional languages.

It’s certainly a good idea to make this choice deliberately, and to error on the side of including
less rather than more. Often as a typeface is being made, it can be tempting to include more and
more glyphs &ndash; but it is frequently more valuable to continue to improve the core set of glyphs
than adding new ones.

## Multi-style family workflow

If you know from the start that you will have more than one font, you will save yourself time if you
plan and build the font family systematically, and work on the styles somewhat in parallel, rather
than completing one style at a time.

It is of course impossible to create *every* style in a completely parallel manner, but it’s
possible to complete a given design step for each style in order to check and be sure about the
relationships between the styles, early in the process. You may find that it is useful to complete
one full set of test letters (such as “adhesion”) for a regular version, and then to make
“adhesion”s for the other styles next. However, you can also make the process even more granular and
make decisions about specific parts of the base letters (such as the ‘n’ and ‘o’) for all styles
together.

Depending on the size and composition of the family you are planning, you may find that it saves
time to make interpolatable instances of glyphs, not only so you can interpolate intermediate
styles, but to aid making design choices about those typographic variables that shift across the
members of a family.  
For a remainder of the variables you should be considering, see the chapter [“What is a
font?”](What_Is_a_Font.html).
