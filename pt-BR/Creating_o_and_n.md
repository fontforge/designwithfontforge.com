title: Creating ‘o’ and ‘n’
---

There are many approaches to designing a font. It can be helpful to deconstruct the larger processes
involved in order to get started quickly, and to provide a solid basis for a whole font’s worth of
characters.  
A popular and valuable approach to this is to design the ‘o’ and ‘n’ characters first, nailing down
essential elements of form, space and balance, before bringing them together for the formation of
other characters. Creating the lowercase ‘o’ and ‘n’ characters can provide us with some of the
fundamental forms and structures that will underpin all other characters that are needed.

Although the design of the ‘o’ may seem like quite a simple thing, all the characteristics mentioned
in the [“What is a font?”] chapter come into play. The choice you make about each characteristic
should be a deliberate choice.

## Underhangs and Overshoots

One way in which optical effects impact type design is in how curves and straight edges appear to
the eye.  
For instance, for a curve and a straight edge to look as though they are aligning correctly on the
baseline, the curve must actually sit a little below the line, producing an *undershoot*. The
portion of the character that dips just below the baseline in order to appear sitting on the
baseline is called the *underhang* &ndash; demonstrated below. Without underhang, characters with
curves around the baseline will appear misaligned within a line of text.

Similarly to the undershoot, an area of *overshoot* is needed to provide the illusion of alignment
at the x-height and at the cap-height (see below).

## Designing the lowercase ‘o’

The design of the ‘o’ is not just a question of the black part of the letter. While the ‘o’ provides
the very basic bowl weight and shape, the white &ndash; or counter &ndash; provides the size and
shape used by the rest of the font.  
In general terms, we can also observe that the round form of the ‘o’ will be echoed in other
characters. These include the b, c, d, e, p, and q, and the form will also implicate the shaping and
forms of curves within any other characters of the font, such as the O, C, D, and Q.

In addition, the white inside the ‘o’ should be utilized when designing the spacing of our font; the
‘o’ sets up the reference rhythm of spaces used between all other glyphs in the font too. These two
values are very related, so essentially you will need to design the amount of white space that are
the side bearings of your ‘o’ as well.  As a general principle, with the exception of slanted or
italic fonts, the ‘o’ should have the same amount of space on the left and right sides, and the
white space between a string of ‘o’ characters should balance the white space inside the ‘o’s.

Here we encroach well into the territory of spacing and metrics, so even at this early stage you
may want to have a look at the [“Spacing, Metrics, and Kerning”] chapter, which covers the basic
implications of spacing in a font.  
That should get you to a well-spaced ‘o’ character, which will help you with the design of the ‘n’.

## Design the lowercase ‘n’

Once you are happy with the form and spacing of your lowercase ‘o’ character as shown with a sample
string, the next step of this approach is to create a suitably shaped, balanced, and well-spaced
lowercase ‘n,’ which you will inject into your string of ‘o’s.

If we look at the anatomy of an ‘n’, we can break it apart into two or three components consisting of a <i>stem</i> and a <i>curve</i>.  
This approach can give us a shortcut to keeping balance and harmony within our characters as they
are formed, and as our set of characters grows. Looking at the sample ‘n’ below; it is broken into
two components. These separate components combine together to form an ‘n’, but the same components
will be re-used later when forming other characters; e.g., the stem at the left of the ‘n’ can be
used to form the left-sided stem of all other lowercase characters.

Taking yourself forward again to the chapter on spacing and metrics, the design of the ‘n’ character
should keep pace with the process of spacing the ‘n’ and ‘o’ characters together.

Now, garnering the methods you have used to create an ‘n’ and ‘o’ character, you are ready to expand
the lowercase character set. The qualities of the stem and curve components of the ‘n’ and ‘o’ will
inform the way you may form other characters.  
If we study the characters below from [Open Sans], we can see the relationships between the formal
aspects of separate characters and how they can be repeated, with some adjustments, to form the
components of our font.
